## Footnotes

Lorem ipsum[^1] dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.[^2]

[^1]: This is the footnote 1
[^2]: 
    This is the footnote 2, which is multiline and you can go on
    and on and on

## Formatting


Text can be {--deleted--} and replacement text {++added++}. This can also be
combined into {~~one~>a single~~} operation. {==Highlighting==} is also
possible {>>and comments can be added inline<<}.

{==

Formatting can also be applied to blocks by putting the opening and closing
tags on separate lines and adding new lines between the tags and the content.

## Testing

Create the container and show output from container as well as the service details (for the same container)


??? info "....Continued"

    <div class="annotate" markdown>
    Now do multiple container operations (exec, inspect, logs, top) using (container/service name, service id, container id, task name)
    ``` { .console .annotate }
    $ dcladmin docker exec -it mycont (1)
    $ dcladmin docker run --name mycont -h mycont -itd alpine sh -c "while true; do date; echo In_the_Loop; sleep 5; done" (1)
    2rg3gji4esa03ltwdyee0cz0o (1)
    ```

    </div>

    1.   container name requested (same as service name)
