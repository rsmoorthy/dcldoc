# Installation


Please complete the [Installation](installation.md) section that installs DCL. Installing DCL requires
a functioning Docker Swarm. For a minimal installation, DCL can be installed on your laptop on an existing Docker
installation. For testing various features of DCL, it can be installed on your laptop as multiple docker containers
in privilege mode, running docker-in-docker. For a production and full-fledged installation, DCL can be installed on
on-premise or AWS cloud. The [Installation](installation.md) page describes the different ways of installing
DCL and its pre-requisites.
